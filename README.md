## 🥷 About Me

- **Guerrilla Coder:** I code in the shadows—no rules, just curiosity.
- **Musician:** My main gig (literally) is making music. 🎶
- **Math & Mayhem:** I love hacking away at mathematical problems, shaders, and visual magic.

---

## 🛠️ Secret Toolbox

- **Python:** For when I want to get things done fast.
- **C++:** When I want to get close to the metal (and maybe set something on fire).
- **Next.js:** Because the web is the wild west.
- **three.js & Shaders:** For bending reality (or at least pixels).

## 🎲 Random Fact

I sometimes write code to generate music, and music to inspire code.  
Does it make sense? Maybe not. Is it fun? Absolutely.

## 🤫 Psst...

- I don’t do this for a living—I do it for the thrill.
- Send me a math riddle, or a weird coding challenge, and watch me disappear into the night, only to emerge with... something.

## 🦄 Find Me (maybe)

If you see a mysterious repo update at 3AM, it was probably me.
